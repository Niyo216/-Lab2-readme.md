HARDWARE; The physical parts of computing devices – those that you can actually touch – are referred to as hardware.

# HARD DRIVES AND MEMORY

The performance of a hard disk is very important to the overall speed of the system – a slow hard disk having the potential to hinder a fast processor like no other system component – and the effective speed of a hard disk is determined by a number of factors.

# The difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive.

Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head, after a completed seek. It is easily calculated from the spindle speed, being the time for half a rotation. A drive’s average access time is the interval between the time a request for data is made by the system and the time the data is available from the drive.

The disk transfer rate (sometimes called media rate) is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media (actual disk platter) and is a function of the recording frequency. It is generally described in megabytes per second (MBps). Modern hard disks have an increasing range of disk transfer rates from the inner diameter to the outer diameter of the disk. This is called a zoned recording technique. The key media recording parameters relating to density per platter are Tracks Per Inch (TPI) and Bits Per Inch (BPI). A track is a circular ring around the disk. TPI is the number of these tracks that can fit in a given area (inch). BPI defines how many bits can be written onto one inch of a track on a disk surface.

The host transfer rate is the speed at which the host computer can transfer data across the IDE/EIDE or SCSI interface to the CPU. It is more generally referred to as the data transfer rate, or DTR, and can be the source of some confusion. Some vendors list the internal transfer rate, the rate at which the disk moves data from the head to its internal buffers. Others cite the burst data transfer rate, the maximum transfer rate the disk can attain under ideal circumstances and for a short duration. More important for the real world is the external data transfer rate, or how fast the hard disk actually transfers data to a PC’s main memory.

# How hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive. 

A solid state drive is a storage device that uses solid state memory to store data. While technically not a disk, a solid state drive will often be referred to as a solid state disk drive, or a solid state disk, in reference to the fact that, in some ways, it replaces the traditional hard disk drive.

The principle behind solid state drives is that there should be no moving parts: no spinning platters, no moving heads. Data is split into word length pieces and stored in memory. Solid state disks use either NAND flash or SDRAM (non-volatile and volatile storage respectively). NAND flash is so-called because of the NAND-gate technology it uses and is common in USB flash drives and many types of memory card.

Hard disk drives have been a faithful servant to computing for many years. But with heads, platters, magnetic surfaces, spindles and an array of other complex moving parts, they are most certainly fallible.

# RAM: Random Access Memory
Primary Memory or a temporary storage:

# Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster? 
 because when the memory is too low it may not hold all the data the CPU needs. when this happens some of the data need to be kept on the slower hard drive to compansate for the low memory. so, instead of the data to go back from CPU it has to do extra work to go back to the hard drive, When this happens  it slows down the computer. In order to solve all these, you need to increse the amount of RAM on the computer, and by increasing a memory more data can be loaded in the fast RAM without the need of constantly accessing the slower hard drive.

# What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths? 
The term 64 or 32 bit data path refers to the number of bits of data that are transferred in 1 clock cycle.
DIMM; Transfers 64 bits at a time.
SIMM; Transfers 32 bits at a time.

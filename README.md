# Here is a heading; Information Systems for Business and Beyond: Chapter 2 - Hardware

HARDWARE; The physical parts of computing devices – those that you can actually touch – are referred to as hardware.

# HARD DRIVES AND MEMORY

The performance of a hard disk is very important to the overall speed of the system – a slow hard disk having the potential to hinder a fast processor like no other system component – and the effective speed of a hard disk is determined by a number of factors.

# The difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive.

Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head, after a completed seek.

The disk transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media and is a function of the recording frequency.

The host transfer rate is the speed at which the host computer can transfer data across the IDE/EIDE or SCSI interface to the CPU.

# How hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive. 

A solid state drive is a storage device that uses solid state memory to store data. While technically not a disk, a solid state drive will often be referred to as a solid state disk drive, or a solid state disk, in reference to the fact that, in some ways, it replaces the traditional hard disk drive.

The principle behind solid state drives is that there should be no moving parts: no spinning platters, no moving heads. Data is split into word length pieces and stored in memory. Solid state disks use either NAND flash or SDRAM (non-volatile and volatile storage respectively). NAND flash is so-called because of the NAND-gate technology it uses and is common in USB flash drives and many types of memory card.

Hard disk drives have been a faithful servant to computing for many years. But with heads, platters, magnetic surfaces, spindles and an array of other complex moving parts, they are most certainly fallible.

# RAM: Random Access Memory
Primary Memory or a temporary storage:

# Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster? 
 because when the memory is too low it may not hold all the data the CPU needs. when this happens some of the data need to be kept on the slower hard drive to compansate for the low memory. so, instead of the data to go back from CPU it has to do extra work to go back to the hard drive, When this happens  it slows down the computer. In order to solve all these, you need to increse the amount of RAM on the computer, and by increasing a memory more data can be loaded in the fast RAM without the need of constantly accessing the slower hard drive.

# What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths? 
The term 64 or 32 bit data path refers to the number of bits of data that are transferred in 1 clock cycle.
DIMM; Transfers 64 bits at a time.
SIMM; Transfers 32 bits at a time.

# ALU and the Control Unit 
 # The interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU:
 The control unit tells the ALU what operation to perform on that data and the ALU stores the result in an output register.

# IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design.
  The purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design.
  
  On 1 January 1963, the AIEE and the IRE merged to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE. At its formation, IEEE had 150,000 members, 140,000 of whom resided in the United States. Over the decades that followed, the social roles of the technologies under IEEE’s aegis continued to spread across the world and reach into more and more areas of people's lives.
  
IEEE, an association dedicated to advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity, is the world's largest technical professional society. It is designed to serve professionals involved in all aspects of the electrical, electronic, and computing fields and related areas of science and technology that underlie modern civilization.

IEEE's roots go back to 1884 when electricity began to become a major influence in society. There was one major established electrical industry, the telegraph, which since the 1840s had come to connect the world with a data communications system faster than the speed of transportation. The telephone and electric power and light industries had just gotten underway.
  
  
 # Data Representation: Numeric Conversions 
 
 The difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers 
 The numbers in a hex, binary are the same as decimal numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The difference between a hex and a decimal is that a hex also contains letters.
 
 
 # Data Representation: Hexadecimal Color Representation 
 
  The representation: #ff016b
  In a RGB color space, hex #ff016b is composed of 100% red.
